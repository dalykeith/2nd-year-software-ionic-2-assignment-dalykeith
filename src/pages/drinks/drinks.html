  <h2>O'Connells</h2>
  <p>
    O’Connell’s was  once a grocery and a small bar but has been solely a pub since the 1970’s. Our décor is truly stunning, with all original features including tiled floors, antique lighting, stained glass windows, solid wooden seating and an amazing pressed tin ornate ceiling in the main bar. Historic photos line the walls. The pub is currently subject to a preservation order so it will be staying much the same for the foreseeable future. The long bar also displays a wide range of whiskeys.

    O’Connell’s is a popular venue attracting a diverse crowd, although it is particularly popular with professionals especially in the early evening after work. It has undergone expansion since it was sold in 2006. The venue now boasts one of Galway City’s best outdoor beer gardens which doubles as a smoking area and BBQ area. The beer garden features large picnic tables and wooden decking where its easy to forget you are in the very centre of the City. Parts of the beer garden are covered and heated so even in Winter you can at least pretend Ireland has a warm climate!
