    "family park for good walk and fun"
  </ion-card-header>
  <ion-card-content>
    "Renville park is about 5mins drive from oranmore and overlooks galway bay and sailing club.
    We go to Renville park fairly often with the family. Its a good park for a walk, run or just to relax. The paths have a good tarmac surface and there's a playground to motivate the kids to walk or run at a decent pace. Most weekends, there is a coffee and ice-cream vendor present. There is an   exercise equipment area also. 
    Outside the park, there is a lovely 4-5km walk by the sea with good paths. Myself and kids love to go through a few stones in the sea. Simple fun and good to Hurn off energy.
    Go along any time of year for some fresh air and exercise."
